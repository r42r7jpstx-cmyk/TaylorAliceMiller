    <h1>
      Healthcare Distribution Executive<br>
      Founder of All States M.E.D.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Operating at the intersection of regulated healthcare distribution and long-term strategic investment.
      Focused on institutional credibility, compliance discipline, and sustainable market development
      within complex healthcare ecosystems.

<!-- ABOUT / BACKGROUND -->
<section>
  <div class="section-inner grid grid-2">
    <img src="portrait-main.jpg">
    <div>
      <h2 class="section-title">About Taylor</h2>
      <p>
        Taylor A. Miller entered the healthcare and medical device sector with a deliberate intention
        to understand how regulated systems operate beneath surface-level commercial activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the outset, her focus has not been on transactional volume, but on the structural
        mechanisms that allow healthcare distribution to function sustainably across institutions,
        jurisdictions, and regulatory environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her work reflects a systems-oriented mindset—examining how compliance, operational discipline,
        and long-term stakeholder alignment interact to create durable value in healthcare markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        This perspective distinguishes her approach from conventional intermediaries, positioning
        her work closer to infrastructure-building than short-term commercial brokerage.

<!-- VALUES -->
<section>
  <div class="section-inner grid grid-2">
    <div>
      <h2 class="section-title">Values & Independence</h2>
      <p>
        Independence is not a stylistic preference for Taylor, but a structural requirement
        for responsible decision-making in regulated industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        She maintains professional autonomy to ensure that operational, regulatory, and ethical
        considerations are not compromised by short-term incentives or external pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        This independence allows her to define clear boundaries, decline misaligned engagements,
        and preserve accountability across all professional interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In environments where risk is shared across institutions and patients,
        such discipline becomes a prerequisite rather than a differentiator.
      </p>
    </div>

<!-- PROFESSIONAL FOCUS -->
<section>
  <div class="section-inner">
    <h2 class="section-title">Professional Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Taylor’s professional focus spans strategic oversight, operational coordination,
      and institutional engagement within the medical device distribution landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her work involves aligning compliant distribution frameworks with long-term market
      requirements, while maintaining sensitivity to regulatory, logistical, and clinical constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than optimizing for rapid expansion, she prioritizes resilience, clarity,
      and adaptability within evolving healthcare systems.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- INVESTMENT -->
<section>
  <div class="section-inner">
    <h2 class="section-title">Investment Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Taylor approaches investment as a continuation of operational understanding,
      rather than as an abstract financial activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She evaluates opportunities through the lenses of regulatory sustainability,
      institutional participation, and long-term systemic relevance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This philosophy naturally excludes speculative behavior, favoring patient capital
      deployed in environments where governance and structure support enduring value.
    </p>
  </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2 class="section-title">Compliance & Ethics</h2>
      <p>
        Compliance is treated as an operational foundation rather than a procedural obligation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taylor emphasizes ethical clarity, documentation discipline, and transparency
        across all stages of engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regulated healthcare environments, such principles function as safeguards
        for institutional credibility and long-term trust.
